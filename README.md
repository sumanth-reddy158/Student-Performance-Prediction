# Student Performance Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts student performance (grades) using machine learning techniques. The main analysis and modeling are in the notebook `Student_Performance_Prediction.ipynb`.

## Files
- `Student_Performance_Prediction.ipynb` — main notebook with EDA, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Common packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter

Install dependencies:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
python -m pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## How to run
1. Open the notebook with Jupyter Lab or Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook "Student_Performance_Prediction.ipynb"
```

2. Run the cells in order. Ensure dataset files (if any) are placed in a `data/` folder or update the notebook paths accordingly.

## Notes
- If you want, provide the dataset location, author name, or license and I will update this README.
